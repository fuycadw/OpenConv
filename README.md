Description
-----------

The project was partly based on an earily version of a close source
project "Conv". The source of latest version of Conv was lost, I then
rebuild this project as a basic/lite prototype version so people can 
use it for further improvenmt.

The source code served as an example of how OpenConv works, it is, by 
no means, a commercial grade product. It might contain errors or flaws,
and it was created for demonstration purpose only.

The Simplified / Traditional Chinese conversion table used by OpenConv 
was based on MediaWiki's ZhConversion.php:

https://doc.wikimedia.org/mediawiki-core/master/php/html/ZhConversion_8php_source.html

A 10.9 SDK-based, pre-compiled version of OpenConv was provided with 
the source for the convenience of those end-users without Xcode 
installed.


Changelog
---------

v1.1:
* Bug fix.
* Add filename converting function.

v1.0:
* Initial release.
