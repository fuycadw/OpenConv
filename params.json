The source of latest version of Conv was lost, I then\r\nrebuild this project as a basic/lite prototype version so people can \r\nuse it for further improvenmt.\r\n\r\nThe source code served as an example of how OpenConv works, it is, by \r\nno means, a commercial grade product. It might contain errors or flaws,\r\nand it was created for demonstration purpose only.\r\n\r\nThe Simplified / Traditional Chinese conversion table used by OpenConv \r\nwas based on MediaWiki's ZhConversion.php:\r\n\r\nhttps://doc.wikimedia.org/mediawiki-core/master/php/html/ZhConversion_8php_source.html\r\n\r\nA 10.9 SDK-based, pre-compiled version of OpenConv was provided with \r\nthe source for the convenience of those end-users without Xcode \r\ninstalled.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\n**Copyright (C) 2013  Cai, Zhi-Wei.**\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
